      <description>The conference is being held at the Wellington Campus of Massey University. The Wellington Campus is located on a small hill at the South end of Wellington’s central Te Aro suburb. The main entrance to the campus is off Wallace Street (confusingly, Wallace Street is a continuation of Taranaki Street). It can also be accessed off Tasman Street or through the Pukeahu National War Memorial Park.
GETTING TO CAMPUS For those conference delegates staying in downtown Wellington, especially in one of the nominated conference hotels, the campus is best reached on foot.</description>
