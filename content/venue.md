The conference is being held at the Wellington Campus of Massey University. The Wellington Campus is located on a small hill at the South end of Wellington’s central Te Aro suburb. The main entrance to the campus is off Wallace Street (confusingly, Wallace Street is a continuation of Taranaki Street). It can also be accessed off Tasman Street or through the Pukeahu National War Memorial Park. 

#### GETTING TO CAMPUS
For those conference delegates staying in downtown Wellington, especially in one of the nominated conference hotels, the campus is best reached on foot. Massey University is a 15-minute walk from the CQ hotel. 

If you are staying elsewhere in Wellington, there are a number of frequent buses that run past the campus. The particular bus will depend on what direction you are arriving from. If you are travelling from the Railway Station, the #10 and #11 buses travel past the campus.

For those who are driving, we have arranged a “parking amnesty.” This means that delegates are free to park in any unreserved, unnamed or unnumbered parks on campus, including the King Street carpark. 

#### ACCESSIBILITY
Wellington is a hilly city, although a comparatively compact one, and the Massey campus is likewise spread across a hilly area.

The hotel accommodation for the conference is a comfortable walking distance from the facilities on campus for able-bodied attendees, and we are on major bus-routes from the central city. (Bus numbers 10, 11 and 21 will move from the intersection of Manners St and Courtney Place up Taranaki St onto Wallace St and past the campus, and Wellington buses have provisions for people with impaired mobility.)

The campus itself provides accessibility measures wherever possible, but cannot entirely circumvent the hilly nature of the campus that results in many sets of stairs.  If you have any accessibility or mobility questions, please ask at the Registration Desk or contact us at: 2021AHSN@gmail.com so that we can work with you on finding convenient alternatives.


#### PLACES TO GRAB A COFFEE/FOOD 
Tussock cafe is located off the Pyramid and offers a range of food and drinks. 

For those venturing slightly further afield, upper Cuba Street is a 15-minute walk and contains a wide range of Wellington’s best cafes and bars ranging from the Ekim burger caravan to Wellington coffee institutions like Fidel’s or Midnight Espresso, to fine-dining at Logan Brown. 

Some other local highlights include:
* Rasa 		 200 Cuba St 		(*Malaysian and South Indian food*)
* Ombra	 	199 Cuba St 		(*Venetian food*)
* Loretta	 	181 Cuba St 		(*Casual cafe with a focus on local and organic*)
* Floriditas	 161 Cuba St 		(*Bit more upmarket with a focus on seasonal food*)

* Tap Room 	91 Aro St 		(*House bar of the Garage Project brewery*)
* Noble Rot 	6 Swan Lane 		(*A wine bar for a change*)

These are just the beginning though, please go out and explore our wonderful city! 

Cuba Street tends to be a more casual, crafty, foodie part of town. If you’re after a few more drinks and a dance (and a fight), then you’ll want to head to Courtney Place. There are some nice spots around the Harbour between Queen’s Wharf and Oriental Bay, while to the South of the campus, the suburb of Newtown offers an eclectic range of options.
